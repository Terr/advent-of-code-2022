# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I completed all (minus half a day) in Python and started with doing some of them in Elixir. My intent is to solve more exercises in different languages, like Rust and Haskell, to see how their strengths change how you get to a solution.

## Goals & guidelines

I set some goals and guidelines for myself.

### Python

#### Goals

* Keep my knowledge about Python fresh
* Use recent additions, like pattern matching, where suitable
* Have fun!

#### Rules & guidelines

* Prioritize readability over clever tricks (remember the Zen of Python!)
* Do not use external dependencies
* Use the strengths of the language (e.g. easy to use iterables, different paradigms, extensive standard library)

### Elixir

#### Goals

* Learn more about the language
* Don't be afraid to learn by example
* Use the strengths of the language: pattern matching, immutability of data. Avoid traditional loops. 
* Have fun!

#### Rules & guidelines

* Prioritize readability over clever tricks
* Do not use external dependencies
