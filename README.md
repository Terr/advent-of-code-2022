# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Currently only in Python but I'm planning to do a few assignments in other languages (like Rust or Elixir) to see how their strengths changes how you get to a solution.

## Goals & guidelines

I set some goals and guidelines for myself.

### Goals

* Keep my knowledge about Python fresh
* Use recent additions, like pattern matching, where suitable
* Have fun!

### Rules & guidelines

* Prioritize readability over clever tricks (remember the Zen of Python!)
* Do not use external dependencies
* Use the strengths of the language (e.g. easy to use iterables, different paradigms, extensive standard library)
